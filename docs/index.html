<p>Today, something remarkable happened.<br>
<br>
  Miguel Roca, a datapunk, 
  <br>
  was suddenly attacked when he was out <em>running.</em><br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately for the dog,<br>
  <br>
  <p>he tapped into his primal instincts and pounced<em>upon the hound!</em></p>
  <br>
<p>Eyewitnesses later said that he must have been 
  <br>
  <em>barking mad.</em></p>
