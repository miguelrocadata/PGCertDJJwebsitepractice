<p>Today, something remarkable happened.</p><br>
<br>
  <p>Miguel Roca, a <em>datapunk</em>,</p><br> 
  <br>
  was suddenly attacked when he was out <br><em>running.</em><br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately for the dog,<br>
  <br>
  <p>he tapped into his primal instincts and pounced
  <br>
  <em>upon the hound!</em></p>
  <br>
<p>Eyewitnesses later said that he must have been 
  <br>
  <br><em>barking mad.</em></p>
