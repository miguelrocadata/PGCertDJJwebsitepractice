<h1>Miguel bites dog</h1>
  <img src="vicious beast.jpg" alt="vicious beast" style="width:150px;height:250px;">
<p>Today, something remarkable happened.</p>
<p>He was attacked when <em>running</em></p>
  <p>Unfortunately for the dog he tapped into his primal instincts and pounced <em>upon the hound!</em></p>
<p>Eyewitnesses later said that he must have been <em>barking mad.</em></p>
