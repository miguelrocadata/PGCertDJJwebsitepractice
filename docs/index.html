<p>Today, something remarkable happened.</p>
<p>Miguel Roca, a datapunk, was suddenly attacked when he was out <em>running.</em><br>Unfortunately for the dog<br>
  <br>
  he tapped into his primal instincts and pounced<br><em>upon the hound!</em></p>
  <br>
<p>Eyewitnesses later said that he must have been <em>barking mad.</em></p>
