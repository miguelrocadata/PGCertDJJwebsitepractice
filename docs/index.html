<p>Today, something remarkable happened.</p>
<p>Miguel Roca, a datapunk, was suddenly attacked when he was out <em>running.</em><br></p>
  <p>Unfortunately for the dog he tapped into his primal instincts and pounced <em>upon the hound!<br></em></p>
<p>Eyewitnesses later said that he must have been <em>barking mad.</em></p>
